## Blog Website Project
This web application is designed to provide a platform for users to create, manage, and share blog posts. 

# What I learned: 
**Web Development with Python:**
  - I utilized the Flask framework to build the backend of the application, which allowed me to understand the principles of web routing, request handling, and response generation.
  - I learned how to create RESTful APIs, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend components of the application.

**Database Management:**
- I implemented a relational database using SQLite to store user data and blog posts. This experience taught me about database design, normalization and how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations effectively.
- I also gained experience in using SQL queries to interact with the database, which enhanced my understanding of data retrieval and manipulation.
