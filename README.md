# Blog Website Project
This web application is designed to provide a platform for users to create, manage and share blog posts. 

## Key Features: 
**Web Development with Python:**
  - I utilized the Flask framework to build the backend of the application, which allowed me to understand the principles of web routing, request handling, and response generation.
  - I learned how to create RESTful APIs, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend components of the application.

**Frontend Development with Bootstrap:**
  - I designed a responsive user interface using Bootstrap, which allowed me to create a visually appealing and mobile-friendly layout. This experience taught me the importance of responsive design and how to utilize      pre-built components to speed up development.
  - I learned how to integrate frontend and backend technologies, allowing for dynamic content updates without requiring full page reloads.
